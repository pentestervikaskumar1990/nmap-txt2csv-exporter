**Nmap to CSV Converter**
A lightweight and efficient Python script designed to parse standard nmap command output from a text file (.txt) and convert it into a structured, easy-to-analyze Comma-Separated Values file (.csv).

**Description**
This tool solves a common problem for security professionals, network administrators, and pentesters: making Nmap scan results more accessible. While Nmap's output is rich with information, it's not ideal for data analysis, reporting, or importing into other tools. This converter extracts key data points (IP, Port, Protocol, State, Service, and Version) and organizes them into a clean CSV format, ready for spreadsheets, databases, or further processing.
